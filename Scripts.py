# Writing programs and running them

# Script = text file with .py extension
# Its commun to use IDEto create scripts like the VsCode used in this reminder

a = 20
b = 12

sum = a + b
sub = a - b
mul = a * b
div = a / b

print("So here's the example of an script about some basic math")
print(sum)
print(type(sub))
print(type(div))
print(mul)

# note that because python is a language with low level of datatype(you dont need to declare the type of a variable)
# when i print the type of sub and the type of div, both has diferent types automatically, so the language does that
# (it has some problems about it but that can be talked after)
